# ConSenSys
AthenDAO &amp; ArchiDAO &amp; EducationDAO together with Consensys


# Idea 1
Using something similar to GIT in order to track changes of a publicly designed 3D model to be able to pay out royalties to those who participated to a popular (need voting principles) design. 


# Idea 2
Having a simple public interface to make one-self available for work. Like the status on social media / TEAMS, however done with crypto for your unique DeeWork crypto identity. Possible use-case in ArchiDAO.
